## Language: ProverML

ProverML is a formal verification language designed for incremental proof construction. It emphasizes explicit lemma declaration, typed components, and a symbolic combination mechanism. It's not human-readable in the traditional sense; its "readability" comes from its strict adherence to formal logic.

### Core Concepts:

1.  **Lemmas (`LEMMA`):** The fundamental unit of proof. Each lemma is a typed proposition or a typed function that returns a proposition.
2.  **Types (`TYPE`):** Every constant, variable, and lemma has an explicit type. ProverML uses a Hindley-Milner like type inference system, but declarations are explicit for clarity.
    *   Basic Types: `Bool`, `Nat`, `Int`, `Str` (for labels/identifiers, not for computation).
    *   Function Types: `A -> B`
    *   Product Types: `A * B`
    *   Dependent Types: `(x:A) -> B(x)` (limited support, primarily for proofs about indexed structures).
3.  **Functions (`FUNC`):** Typed transformations. Can be pure functions or functions that derive propositions.
4.  **Combinators (`COMBINE`):** Symbolic operations to chain lemmas together. These are essentially proof rules.
5.  **Proof State (`PROOF_STATE`):** An implicit global context that accumulates proven lemmas.
6.  **Assertions (`ASSERT`):** The final statement to be proven, referencing a previously established lemma.

### Syntax (Highly Symbolic and Non-Human-Readable):

**General Structure:**

```
<DECLARATION_KEYWORD> <IDENTIFIER> : <TYPE> <VALUE_OR_DEFINITION>
```

**Key Prefixes/Keywords:**

*   `λ`: Lambda abstraction for anonymous functions/propositions.
*   `∀`: Universal quantifier.
*   `∃`: Existential quantifier.
*   `->`: Implication / Function type.
*   `/\`: Logical AND (conjunction).
*   `\/`: Logical OR (disjunction).
*   `==`: Equality.
*   `_T_`: Type declaration.
*   `_F_`: Function declaration.
*   `_L_`: Lemma declaration.
*   `_C_`: Combinator declaration.
*   `_A_`: Assert/Prove declaration.
*   `_G_`: Given/Assumption.
*   `_P_`: Proof (block, implicit in `_C_` and `_L_`).
*   `_S_`: Store (add to proof state).

### Example ProverML Script:

Let's prove a simple property: If `x` is even and `y` is even, then `x + y` is even.

**Assumption Encoding:**

*   `IsEven(n)`: A predicate, `n` is even. For simplicity, assume its definition is externally provided or foundational. We'll represent it as a `Nat -> Bool` function.
*   `+`: Standard natural number addition.

### Explanation of Components in the Example:

*   **Type Declarations (`_T_`):** Establishes the basic types `Nat` and `Bool`.
*   **Function Declarations (`_F_`):**
    *   `IsEven`: Defined as `Nat -> Bool`. The `λ` defines its behavior (n modulo 2 is 0).
    *   `Add`: Defined as `Nat -> Nat -> Nat` (curried function).
*   **Lemma Declarations (`_L_`):**
    *   `even_as_2k`:
        *   **Type:** `( (n:Nat) -> (IsEven(n) -> (∃ k:Nat. (n == (2 * k)))) )` reads as: "For any `n` of type `Nat`, if `IsEven(n)` is true, then there exists a `k` of type `Nat` such that `n` equals `2 * k`."
        *   `_G_`: "Given" - specifies the universally quantified variables and premises for this lemma.
        *   `_P_`: "Proof" - this is where the ProverML internal logic engine would perform its steps. For human illustration, I've put comments like `(n == (2 * (n / 2)))`, but in a real system, this would be a sequence of primitive proof tactics or references to axioms.
        *   `_S_`: "Store" - adds the proven lemma to the global `PROOF_STATE` under the given identifier.
    *   `sum_multiples_of_2`: A simple algebraic lemma.
    *   `even_decomp_x_y`:
        *   **Type:** A conjunctive statement asserting the existence of two different `k` values.
        *   `_C_`: "Combinator" - this is where lemmas are explicitly chained. `(even_as_2k x (IsEven(x)))` means "apply the `even_as_2k` lemma with `x` as the `n` argument and `IsEven(x)` as the premise." The arrow `->` indicates that the result of this application (the conclusion of `even_as_2k`) is then used. ProverML's internal engine manages the logical flow and variable binding.
    *   `sum_of_evens_is_even`: The main theorem we want to prove.
        *   It uses `_C_` to invoke `even_decomp_x_y`, effectively performing existential elimination to get `k1` and `k2`.
        *   Then, it proceeds with `_P_` to perform the substitutions and apply `sum_multiples_of_2` to reach the final conclusion `IsEven((Add x y))`.
*   **Assertion (`_A_`):** The final statement `_A_ sum_of_evens_is_even` signifies that we are asserting that the lemma `sum_of_evens_is_even` has been successfully proven and is now considered a theorem. The type is repeated for verification.

This ProverML mock-up emphasizes the structured, step-by-step nature of formal proof, where each piece of knowledge (lemma) is built upon previously established ones, and every component is rigorously typed to ensure consistency and correctness. The non-human-readable aspect stems from its focus on machine-verifiability rather than developer convenience.
