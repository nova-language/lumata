## My Conceptual Language: "SynapseWeave"

SynapseWeave is a highly specialized, proof-oriented language designed for the automated construction and verification of complex algorithms. It prioritizes formal correctness and composability over human readability. Think of it as a low-level assembly for a theorem prover.

---

### Core Principles of SynapseWeave:

1.  **Atomic Lemmas:** Every single verifiable statement or computational step is a "Lemma."
2.  **Type-Driven Proofs:** All data, intermediate results, and even the lemmas themselves are rigorously typed. This allows for early error detection and automated type inference for proof obligations.
3.  **Combinatorial Construction:** Complex algorithms are built by composing simpler, already proven lemmas. This is the "SynapseWeave" – weaving together discrete neural connections (lemmas) to form a larger thought (algorithm).
4.  **No Direct Control Flow (Mostly):** Traditional `if/else`, `for/while` are abstracted away. Control flow is implicit in the application of typed functions and the satisfaction of preconditions within lemma composition. Recursion is handled via fixed-point combinators on typed functions.
5.  **Non-Human Readable (Intentional):** Syntax is optimized for machine parsing and verification, not human comprehension. Indentation, comments, and meaningful variable names are *strictly forbidden* in the core definition for compactness and to avoid ambiguity.

### SynapseWeave Syntax Elements:

*   `λ`: Lambda abstraction (for functions).
*   `Π`: Product type (for universal quantification, `forall`).
*   `Σ`: Sum type (for existential quantification, `exists`).
*   `→`: Function type.
*   `:=`: Definition.
*   `::`: Type annotation.
*   `◊`: Lemma declaration keyword.
*   `@`: Application operator (function application or lemma application).
*   `[` `]`: Type parameterization / Type application.
*   `{` `}`: Term grouping / Tuple construction.
*   `_`: Wildcard or placeholder (used during type inference).
*   `¬`: Logical negation.
*   `∧`: Logical conjunction.
*   `∨`: Logical disjunction.
*   `⇔`: Logical equivalence.
*   `∎`: End of definition/proof segment.

---

### Basic Types:

*   `U`: Universe (the type of all types, for meta-lemmas).
*   `𝔹`: Boolean.
*   `ℕ`: Natural numbers.
*   `𝕃[T]`: List of type `T`.
*   `𝕍[N, T]`: Vector of size `N` with elements of type `T`.
*   `𝔽[K, V]`: Finite Map (Dictionary) from `K` to `V`.
*   `ℙ[T]`: Set of elements of type `T`.
*   `≺`: Proof Type (indicates a proposition that can be proven).

### Example SynapseWeave Session (Mocking a simple algorithm: list reversal)

We'll declare lemmas one by one, then combine them.

**Goal:** Reverse a list `𝕃[ℕ]`.

---

#### Lemma 1: `id_elem` - Identity element for concatenation (empty list)

**Type:** `∀ T:U, 𝕃[T] → 𝕃[T] → 𝕃[T] → ≺ (λ l1 l2 l3. (l1 ⊕ l2) ⇔ l3 )` (Informal: For any type T, concatenation is associative.)
*   `⊕` would be a built-in concatenation operation.

```synapseweave
◊ id_elem :: Π[T:U] → ≺ (λ l:𝕃[T]. (𝕃[T].nil ⊕ l) ⇔ l ∧ (l ⊕ 𝕃[T].nil) ⇔ l) ∎
```
*   **Translation (Informal):** "Lemma `id_elem` states that for any type `T`, the empty list (`𝕃[T].nil`) is the identity element for list concatenation (`⊕`). That is, concatenating an empty list with `l` (either way) results in `l`."
*   **Proof:** This would be provided by an external prover, but we're just declaring its existence and type.

---

#### Lemma 2: `head_tail_decomp` - Deconstructs a non-empty list

```synapseweave
◊ head_tail_decomp :: Π[T:U] → ≺ (λ l:𝕃[T]. ¬(l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil) → Σ[h:T, t:𝕃[T]]. (l ⇔ (h :: t))) ∎
```
*   **Translation (Informal):** "Lemma `head_tail_decomp` states that for any type `T`, if a list `l` is not empty, then it can be uniquely decomposed into a head `h` (of type `T`) and a tail `t` (of type `𝕃[T]`), such that `l` is equivalent to `h` prepended to `t`."
*   `::` is used here for list cons/prepend.

---

#### Lemma 3: `append_single` - Appending a single element to a list

```synapseweave
◊ append_single :: Π[T:U] → (𝕃[T] → T → 𝕃[T]) := λ l:𝕃[T], x:T.
    match l with
    | 𝕃[T].nil => (x :: 𝕃[T].nil)
    | h :: t   => h :: (@append_single[T] t x)
    end ∎
```
*   **Translation (Informal):** "Defines `append_single` as a function that takes a list `l` and an element `x`, and appends `x` to `l`. If `l` is empty, it returns `x` as a single-element list. Otherwise, it prepends the head `h` to the result of recursively appending `x` to the tail `t`."
*   This is a function, not a lemma itself, but it's a building block. The `match` statement is one of the few exceptions allowing structured control flow.

---

#### Lemma 4: `rev_base_case` - Base case for list reversal (empty list)

```synapseweave
◊ rev_base_case :: Π[T:U] → ≺ (λ l:𝕃[T]. (l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil) → (reverse_fn[T] l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil)) ∎
```
*   **Translation (Informal):** "Lemma `rev_base_case` states that for any type `T`, if a list `l` is empty, then applying the `reverse_fn` to `l` results in an empty list."
*   `reverse_fn` is the function we are trying to define.

---

#### Lemma 5: `rev_inductive_step` - Inductive step for list reversal

```synapseweave
◊ rev_inductive_step :: Π[T:U] → ≺ (λ l:𝕃[T]. ¬(l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil) →
    (let h:T, t:𝕃[T] = @head_tail_decomp[T] l in
    (reverse_fn[T] l ⇔ (@append_single[T] (reverse_fn[T] t) h)))) ∎
```
*   **Translation (Informal):** "Lemma `rev_inductive_step` states that for any type `T`, if a list `l` is not empty, then let `h` be its head and `t` its tail (using `head_tail_decomp`). Then, reversing `l` is equivalent to taking the reversed tail (`reverse_fn t`) and appending the original head (`h`) to it."
*   `let ... = ... in ...` is a bind construct, allowing us to introduce variables from existential quantification.

---

#### Function: `reverse_fn` - The actual list reversal function

This is where we combine the lemmas to define the function. The "proof" is that this definition satisfies the previously declared lemmas.

```synapseweave
reverse_fn :: Π[T:U] → (𝕃[T] → 𝕃[T]) := λ l:𝕃[T].
    if (l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil) then
        𝕃[T].nil
    else
        let h:T, t:𝕃[T] = @head_tail_decomp[T] l in
        @append_single[T] (@reverse_fn[T] t) h
    fi ∎
```
*   **Translation (Informal):** "Defines `reverse_fn` as a function that takes a list `l` of type `T` and returns a list of type `T`. If `l` is empty, it returns an empty list (matching `rev_base_case`). Otherwise, it decomposes `l` into head `h` and tail `t`, recursively reverses `t`, and then appends `h` to the result (matching `rev_inductive_step`)."
*   The `if/then/else` is a pattern-match against the `(l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil)` proposition, which is a common way to handle structural recursion in proof languages.

---

#### Putting it all together (Informal)

A SynapseWeave compiler/prover would:

1.  Read `id_elem`, `head_tail_decomp`, `rev_base_case`, `rev_inductive_step` and add them to its database of known, proven lemmas, noting their precise types.
2.  When it encounters `reverse_fn`'s definition, it would *type-check* the definition against the lemmas.
    *   For the `if (l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil)` branch, it would check if `rev_base_case`'s premises are met and if the returned value `𝕃[T].nil` aligns with the lemma's conclusion.
    *   For the `else` branch, it would check if `rev_inductive_step`'s premises are met (e.g., `¬(l ⇔ 𝕃[T].nil)`), and if the recursive call `(@reverse_fn[T] t)` combined with `@append_single[T]` aligns with the lemma's conclusion.
3.  If all premises align and types match, the `reverse_fn` definition is considered *proven* by construction, leveraging the pre-declared lemmas.

This highly structured, type-driven approach allows for very robust, machine-verifiable algorithms, where every step and property is formally declared and checked. The "not human-readable" part is achieved by stripping away all semantic sugar beyond the bare minimum required for type checking and logical consistency.
